I remember shopping (and playing) at Gamestop so when I heard it was in trouble, I bought more and more stock out of some sentimental sense of helping my \"friend\".  When it was revealed that Melvin was effectively trying to drive GME under, I bought a ton more, watched a bunch of Roaring Kitty videos and then bought even more. \n\nI have refused to part with any shares since unless it was a situation in which Melvin was the one closing its doors.  \n\nI have no idea what I am doing with Stocks.  None.  My understanding of the basic logic is buy low sell high.  None of the money I used to buy stocks was needed elsewhere so I can and will ride this rocket to Pluto and beyond.  Gamestop is a childhood friend and well, I don't have a lot of friends so the ones I do have are worth much more to me than a few bucks. \n\nI hate Melvin and Citadel.  I cannot possibly be the only sentimental sap out here.  Diamond Hands my eye.  I am Diamond hands, arms, legs and johnson.  I will sell when I read of Melvin's bankruptcy and not before. \n\nF-Em!!!",

I know it’s still early but I’m feeling happy that I didnt completely read the chart wrong:\n\nYep, if you look on just about any chart on any symbol. Most breakout bull bars with starting volume like we’ve had on the weekly chart is followed by a pullback, sometimes even 100% or more, but without any stopping volume the trend continues. Look at Tesla on weekly with volume, MRNA, etc, I mean literally almost any chart you can see starting volume, pullback we’re people are like, I told you so, and then trend continuation. Doesn’t mean it’s 100%, most trading is like 50/50, but it doesn’t mean this isn’t a good play.",

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that is not going to happen. Not because anyone here is evil (I am so grateful for the GME tip), but simply because that's not how things work. If, somehow, everyone agreed to sell at $1000, people would sell at $999 to make sure they didn't get stuck. There's simply no way to get the sort of coordinated teamwork around your shares that you are hoping for.\n\nSo looking around to get a sense of price targets is good, but beyond that, it's up to **you** to decide what price you will be happy walking away.",

A little bit of greed is necessary but too much and you live in a cardboard box.   \n\n\nI would suggest selling somewhere in between cardboard box and the monopoly guy.",

It's aaaallllllll gravy after that.\n\n Don't be greedy about it and take some profits on the way up by trimming a few shares at comfortable sell off points for yourself and don't look at what profit you COULD have made and instead focus on the profit you DID make. \n\nBe realistic in your goals, 10,000/share sounds fucking awesome and I hope it reaches it.

I've been holding GME since a little before the spike, was bagholding after it, and more than doubled my position in between spikes.\n\nSo if that is considered diamond-handing, I don't think that's bad.

You want to hold onto a good chunk so you don’t miss out on an explosion. DFV seems to have done everything right, IMO.  He didn’t sit on it all, and become a millionaire only to lose it all..... he took out enough to set himself up for life, but kept enough in to keep making bank if his predictions were right. \n\nI like the stock, and I like the DFV",

I decided rather than lost $10k, I would sell 20 $28 puts for $.90 and claw back some inevitable losses. So I sold those today.\n\nThen a couple hours later you know what happened. IV exploded and those $30 puts are worth $15 now, even though they're super OTM. So instead of being down $10k, I'm up $15 - $20k now, right? Wrong! The puts I sold also exploded in IV, so those went from netting me shy of $2k to being down $18k. The bottom line is I'm not locked into my $2 put spread.\n\nI missed $15k - $20k in gains by trying to claw back $2k an hour earlier. fml but I live for this shit.\n\nI also bought a $20 LEAP call at $50 before this exploded, so I'm not terribly upset given that's trading around $15k profit now and probably more tomorrow. So hopefully I can cover my losses and then some.\n\nOptions are great. I made $140k on the first GME squeeze and was not expecting this at all, though it could be the real deal. I jumped back in today after watching the price movement for 5 minutes. It took me back to January, looked exactly the same with no resistance on the way up. So I'm thinking it's short covering.\n\nGreedy hedgefund assholes who tried to short from $30 and got destroyed, then shorted from $400 after the first squeeze up and didn't close down at $40 where we've been trading. So while they aren't underwater yet, they've probably lost half their profits before the close today on their current shorts. I expect the covering to prevent losing it all again will be something to remember tomorrow.",

I had $30 puts I bought after the last squeeze which drained from $5 premium down to $1 today through IV crush, even as the stock price dropped, before exploding back up to $15 at close today even though they were further OTM.\n\nIV will determine whether OP makes money. If he bought low IV, he's golden. If he bought these in the middle of GME exploding up, he's hosed unless it literally crashes back down to his strike with the same volatility. Any sideways trading for even a week will drive IV down and ruin him.",

That's how I turned $170 gamestop calls in January into $27,000. Part of that was the move up in the price, but the other part was the huge IV increase.\n\nThis is also why you don't want to buy options in high IV environments, where a big move is expected like around earnings, particularly if IV will contract, like what happens after earnings when the news is out and the stock stabalizes. That's called IV crush. You can be right about the direction and still lose money as the options are worth less than when you bought them because the volatility went away.",

So of course, greed set in and I rode the wave and let it go until the next day. The next day market opens I was down to 11,000 from 21,000. I was such a retard that I hoped it would bounce back. Long story short, my options expired way the fuck out of the money and I made a total of -$1000 on that ride.\n\nSell that shit at open tomorrow Immediately. Enjoy the gains while they’re there.",

Both of these calls expire on Friday so if the price of gamestop were below what he paid for the calls and the strike price of the call they would expire worthless. Seeing how GME had been hovering in the 40-50 range it was very unlikely these calls were not going to expire and the ape would have been out the money paid for the calls. \n\nAs I write this GME is currently trading at $166 a share. This idiot can buy 100 shares for 60 and 100 share for $73 which right now would be worth around 20k.

You pay $10 for this option; paying $10 + $4/gallon * 10 gallons = $50 in total seems like a bad deal, but:\n\n1. The price of gas could rise to $5 a gallon or more, in which case buying the option from me and exercising it is cheaper.\n\n2. You never have to buy it at $4/gallon if you don't want to. It's an option for you, not an obligation (it is an obligation to me, that is, if you buy the option and ask me to sell you gas at $4/gallon, I have to no matter what). So if gas is $2.5 by the time the option expires, you simply don't exercise the contract and you pay nothing besides the initial $10.\n\nNow say the price of gas rockets to $8. Now the option is worth at least $40, since you can buy it, exercise it to buy 10gal of gas for $40, and immediately flip it for $80. Every additional $1 the market value of 1 gallon of gas goes up, the option value goes up $10 since it's a contract to buy 10 gallons at a fixed price. \n\nThat's the basics of options and options pricing.",

You can buy call options, which give you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date. You can buy ours which give you the right but not the obligation to sell 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date. \n\nThen there’s selling buys and selling puts but I don’t mess with that so I’m not the one to explain it. \n\nOptions contracts value changes due to a handful of variables including but not limited to (implied volatility, time decay, price of the stock, etc). \n\nEssentially in my position, I’d purchased a call option for GME for the strike price of $99 expiring tomorrow. The cost of the option was $1 per share so it cost me $100. It was so cheap because the odds of GME hitting $99 was pretty low, and the value of that option went way up by the price of GME surpassing $99 but also by it doing it in such a short time as that increases its implied volatility. \n\nWhen it got to a value of $3 (so $300) I sold my contract because I was taking profits but in hindsight 12 minutes later the value was well over $2,000. \n\nLots of good resources to check out as I’m not an expert, but the rule of thumb is generally that if you decide to get into options you should know that you’ll lose a lot of money in the learning process, but that you can potentially make a decent amount of money if you make some smart bets. It’s a very risky side of trading stocks and the majority of people get burned so just make sure you inform yourself to the best of your ability.

I’m sorry I’ve been trying to learn about options for the past few months and sometimes I think I understand but I really don’t understand how things can play our irl obviously because I never even thought about selling a call I previously bought without purchasing the shares like never considered that was a possibility so...back to studying cause I don’t “got it”",

In this case, he has the right to buy shares for $800.07 per share ($80,007 for the pack of 100). If that sounds high, it is. The more unlikely the share price, the cheaper the option is. How much did this option cost him? $0.07 x100, or $7.\n\nHe can either excersise the contract and buy at that price, or let it expire unclaimed and lose the $7 he spent.\n\nOr there's the third choice- instead of using the contract himself, he can sell the rights to someone else. Well, GME just skyrocketed and the $800 share price is a lot more likely than it was before, so the price of the contract has also jumped to $1.19 x100, or $119. He could sell it to someone else and make $112 profit and he never even owned any shares of GME.\n\nAlso note, he has 34 of these calls, all identical. So he's made $112 x34 = $3,808 today if he sells. But he can keep holding and see the price go even higher.\n\nNote, my math may be slightly off. Theres more variables.",

It is a valid question but I didn't want to do an ACATS transfer before earnings or a squeeze. Assuming this keeps going up and I sell at my price target, I plan to put all my GME proceeds into SPY shares and do a partial ACATS to 2 different exchanges. I already have an etrade account and I will likely get Fidelity or vanguard also. I don't really know how any of it works but I'll be cashing out of RH FAST. Just in case RH does fail, I'd need to have under 500K (250 in actual securities) to get covered by SIPC, and my price target would net me more than that. Godspeed 🦍s",

Which is when they “borrow” a share position (whether they exist or not, it would seem, hence all the “naked shorting” terms you might have seen flying around) from a market maker. Once the price drops as they expect it to, they then buy the “borrowed” amount of shares at a cheaper price, return it to the market maker and the difference in price is their profits.\nNow.... as an institutional trader (who has no restrictions placed upon them, unlike us mere retail traders) hears all these plonkers who are up mad amounts now only have the option to sell (coz robinhood etc set a period where that’s all we could do) some will.. price drops.. institutional greedy cunts know the sails have lost their wind and bet HEAVILY that the price is about to fall. Which it did. Because “short selling” also puts downward pressure on the price.\n\nUnfortunately though for those greedy wankers, when they doubled down on the way down. A lot of stubborn apes (god bless you) didn’t sell and instead bought more like brain damaged Demi gods.\n\nAnd now... it’s about to happen ALL OVER AGAIN.\n\nPrice going up. “Short selling” positions get scared. Buy shares to return to market makers which accelerates the fuck out of the price increase (especially when they’ve most likely doubled down even harder than before thinking this would all go away) which it hasn’t. And it isn’t going to. Because everyone bought more. And still aren’t selling. Because the SELL button exists only on the moon.\n\nTLDR: Short positions that opened during the decline of the first wave are now being pressured into closing as “sell walls” are being broken down. \n\nHOLD. BUY with spare money. See you on Nibiru for shots of our own piss. \n\nNot advice. That’s just what I understand.",

Before, you'd scroll past text posts without giving them a moment's thought since they take up no space and all look the same unless you read them.\n\nPictures stand out and grab attention and therefore the ones you consider shit simply stand out more. \n\nThe influx in popularity means there are **more** low quality posts, absolutely. But I'd argue whether or not the **percentage** is much different.\n\nI'd further argue photos brought Reddit into a more creative and interactive space, thus improving overall quality. \n\nLike back then, simply don't follow the subs you think are trash and you've avoided most of the trash.",

            "Comment": "Mythically, the power of DIAMOND HANDS evokes the stories of Proteus, who will spill important secrets for you if you can grab him and HOLD ON as he furiously shapeshifts into various animals and elements...  \n\"This was illustrated in a story written by Virgil.\n\nAristaeus, the [son of Apollo](https://mythologysource.com/apollo-greek-god/),  had been keeping bees but they had all died. He went to Proteus to  learn if there was anything that could be done to prevent the same thing  from happening again in the future.\n\nAristaeus had to capture the god and hold on while he shifted through  several shapes. Proteus turned himself into many different beasts and  animals before giving up.\n\nThe Old Man of the Sea could imitate the forms of any animal of the  sea or of land. He even turned himself into running water, an enormous  tree, and a flame.\n\nHe finally told Aristaeus that the disease that had killed off his  hives was a punishment for his involvement in the death of Eurydice.  Proteus knew what sacrifices to make to the gods to appease them.\n\nWhen Aristaeus did as the Old Man of the Sea advised, he found a  swarm of bees in the carcass of the last animal he sacrificed. He took  it home and never had a problem with his hives again.\n\n### Proteus and Menelaus\n\nThe most famous story of Proteus’s prophesies and shape shifting, however, occurs in Homer’s *Odyssey*.\n\nThe protagonist’s son, Telemachus, had grown to adulthood while his  father was away at war and struggling to make his way home. Believing  that his father was still alive, the young man set out to find  information about him.\n\nTelemachus  made his way to the court of King Menelaus of Sparta, who had  experienced his own trials on the way home from the Trojan War.\n\nMenelaus relayed the story of how his ship had been becalmed on the  island of Pharos during the journey, and after twenty days his men were  nearly out of supplies when he met the helpful sea goddess Eidothea.\n\nAlways a friend to troubled sailors, she informed the king that her  father could tell him what gods he had offended to strand him on their  island. And since he was a king, Proteus would also tell him what had  come to pass in his own palace while he was away.\n\nHowever, Menelaus would have to capture the sea god for him to talk. Eidothea knew how to do that, too.\n\nShe made a plan with Menelaus to trick her father when he was most  vulnerable. Every day at noon Proteus came onto the island to nap among  his herd of seals, in the same way that a shepherd might fall asleep  among his flock.\n\nEidothea could disguise Menelaus and three of his bravest men among  the seals. Then they could take the god by surprise as he was sleeping.\n\nOf course, he would take many forms to avoid being held. Only when he resumed his natural form would it be safe to release him.\n\nMenelaus agreed to the plan and lay in wait with his men among Proteus’s herd of seals.\n\n>Then with a shout we rushed upon him and locked our arms  about him; but the ancient god had not forgotten his craft and cunning.  He became in turn a bearded lion, a snake, a panther, a monstrous boar;  then running water, then a towering and leafy tree; but we kept our  hold, unflinching and undismayed, and in the end this master of dreaded  secrets began to tire. So he broke into speech and asked outright: ‘Son  of Atreus, which of the gods taught you this strategy, to entrap and  overpower me thus? What do you want from me?’  \n \\-Homer, Odyssey 4. 365 ff (trans. Shewring)\n\nProteus was able to tell the Spartan king that his ship was becalmed  because he had failed to make the proper sacrifices to Zeus before he  sailed from Troy. It was fated that Menelaus would not reach home until  he returned to Egypt and made the proper sacrifices of one hundred animals there.\n\nMenelaus  was frustrated that he would have to backtrack to Egypt before reaching  home, but relieved that he knew how to continue on his journey.\"  \n[https://mythologysource.com/proteus-greek-god/](https://mythologysource.com/proteus-greek-god/)",

And no you don't need 450k a year to buy one if you buy it outright. Which who in their right mind wouldn't?  At most over 3 years is 40-50k and that's including insurance. Lambos have great warranties that include oil changes. Tires aren't that expensive and according to your driving would could go with once a year tire change. So let's say 12k a year for tires and insurance. 36k over 3 years.\n\n\nAnd noone is discussing taxes ITT on stock gains when it comes to buying a car. Taxes would be something you take into consideration if you have half a brain.",

Finished work at 19:20 got home 20:00 im getting bombarded by bloomberg, yahoo and so on talking how gme is still in play and that the CFO ehem resigned. Look at portfolio 23:00 GME is rocketing. Just my 2 ct of experience what the media does.\n\nedit: bought 6.2 shares @ 49  ( at 19:00 +2 timezone) since missed the dip in the opening :(",

But I bought shares at in the $350 range, then some in the $270 range. Got screwed by Robinhood, thought I was just going to be holding the shares until the end of days, never making money on them.  I opened an account with Fidelity and WeBull in the meantime because, fuck you Robinhood.   \n\n\nBut I learned quickly that no matter what, you hold. Over the past week I began tracking (literally, I made a spreadsheet) of people who were saying that they were buying shares and how many they were buying. It became obvious that something was going to happen.   \n\n\nI bought a few shares yesterday and then with some nervousness took $500 out of savings to buy 10 more shares today for a total of 23. People are telling me to sell. It would be a significant amount of money for my family. **But....if you all are still holding, then I will hold.**",

Some bought in at 300-500 just to see their accounts decline to near zero. Now that it is rising you may want to cut your losses and just be happy to get your original investment back. \n\nWell, I say fuck that. You've waited and held, while your wife told you to sell. Her boyfriend even told you to sell while he was fucking your wife in the other room.  Now is your time! You may have the order screen up right now, and you have a number in that will get you a nice 5% gain. I tell you this we did this once, we WILL do it again. We will hit at least 450. With the publicity, I think 800 is possible. Hold those 2 fucking shares, hold those calls, take what is yours, your sweet fuckin buckets of tendies.\n\nLet us stick this so far up the shorts ass that they can taste our diamond hands.\n\nHoddor! Were taking off motherfuckers!",

That’s why the puts were losing value even though the stock was going down.\n\nThe puts went up in value when the stock started going up because round 2 squeeze catalyst (degenerates) happened. Since the stock is now expected to move a lot and be volatile, it increases the implied volatility factor of options, which increases the option premium. Since the chances the stock moves a lot and makes your options print tendies is higher, the options MMs have to command a higher premium to try and keep you out of the kitchen.\n\nHope that helps! 🚀🚀🚀",

NFA.  \n\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo over a month ago, GME only had options for strikes below $40. When it first rallied from 19 to 40+.\n\nWhen GME mooned, hedge funds bought GME puts for $40 because it was the highest available strike. They bet that they could ride out this squeeze and accept a maximum price of $40 per share that they shorted.\n\nWhen GME dipped below $40, all of these put holders started to exercise the contracts so that they could hold the shares to exit their short positions.\n\nMy guess is that when GME crossed 40, these guys sold puts at various strikes in the 30s. Because they knew that they would have to buy even more shares to exit their previous short positions.\n\nThey're not exiting the position while fucking over anyone who bought those puts.\n\nOnce they close those puts, they can return their shares and let retail FOMO into this railly while hedge funds try to time the top of this rally and short it back down to earth.  \n\n\nTLDR; Hedge funds exiting short positions, but trying to KANG gang this shit. \n\n(KANG gang is different than Apes. Kangaroos profit from volatility and stonks going up and down. Apes are unable to make money in a bear market)",

If you can get it to count both the company name and ticker together I think you'd have seen GME potentially overtake PLTR at the end of the week since people tend to fully say \"GameStop\" a lot more than \"Palantir\".

You may want to buy a put or sell/write a call.\n\nWhen selling a call, you should make sure you have 100 shares.\nWhen selling a put, you should make sure you have enough money to buy 100 shares at the strike price.\n\nCall buyers are betting against call sellers. Put buyers are going against put sellers.\n\nCalls and puts have intrinsic and extrinsic value when in the money. Calls and puts only have extrinsic value when out of the money.\n\nITM: In the money (good for buyers, bad for sellers)\nOTM: out of the money (good for sellers, bad for buyers)\n\nStrike price < share price? Call ITM, Put OTM\nStrike > Share price? Call OTM, Put ITM.\n\nIntrinsic value (only ITM options): Current Price - Strike (take absolute value of this (aka, turn it positive if negative))\n\nEach contract is for 100 shares\n\nThere you go. Example:\n\nDFV has 500 contracts at a strike price of $12. Assuming Gamestop goes up to $1000, what would the intrinsic value on his contracts be?\n\n(|Share price - strike|)\\*number of contracts*100 shares per contract.\n\n($1000-$12)\\*500*100 = $49,400,000.\n\nAgain, not advice.

Before I buy, I look at Options and I see someone selling a contract for 10 shares with a strike of $100.\n\nI could buy the shares outright for $2,000 or I could buy the contract and exercise it, getting my 10 shares for $1,000 which is half the market rate. But you need to factor in the cost of the Option.\n\nThe Option is not necessarily worth $1,000 simply because it’s the value difference between the strike and market value. It makes no sense to buy the Option for $1,000 and exercise it for another $1,000. I may as well just buy the shares directly. Having said that, some people are stupid and don’t know what they’re buying so you might get lucky. \n\nIf the Option is selling for $500 it’s worth it, since after exercising I’m still in the green; $1,000 for the shares and $500 for the Option ($1,500). In reality these values fluctuate around depending on the stock price and the values tend to be much closer. Exercising also depends on the size of the contract, since not everyone has the liquidity to purchase the shares first then sell them after. AFAIK brokers don’t like it if you’re exercising without the liquidity on hand. \n\nUltimately it depends on if someone thinks your contract is worth that much. Typically the estimates are based on the last traded price so it won’t be far off. But if the price falls quickly you may find there are no buyers for your contract so it might be worth selling your Option while it’s in the green.\n\nNo point exercising it unless you intend on owning the shares.",

Maybe your play money goes to next months electricity, or food or whatever, guess what that ain’t play money then. My bills are paid, and will be paid long after everyone forgets about all of this. And none of that is from the stock market either. So my limit is $0, I have almost 70 shares, for me it’s play money, had I not jumped on the gme train, that money would be new shoes, or a new outfit, or another useless kitchen appliance. If this shit moons to whatever 1000 and then starts to drop off the face of the earth, yea I’ll sell before it hits my buy in average and score some profit. \n\nSelling it before it moons though in your analogy is like taking your chips off the table right after the flop, you still don’t know what your holding, you have some idea but no way to really tell for certain, and you don’t know who else is in or out either, no one has laid a blind (in this case there isn’t even a blind because stocks are already paid for) and you can chose to put in another bid or just hold. For literally $0 extra dollars you can see atleast the next card, but your trying to say walking away is the best option after the last 2 hours of trading today is just crazy, either that or you haven’t realized this is a casino.\n\nI’m not trying to get anyone to do anything, let’s be clear, I wouldn’t even try either as that sir is illegal. So if you would refrain from accusing me of such it would be nice. I’m just stating my views from my point of view. That being someone who can literally lose every dollar invested into gme, and only bought in for the ride, the stories, and most of all the fun of it. A nice pair of shoes will just sit there and get worn every once in a while. Having stories of being up thousands one day and down almost the same the next is a lot more fun in my opinion.\n\nAgain, not here to influence or tell anyone to do anything. Just sharing my opinion like every other person here. It’s been fun, 💎🤲🏼 to Pluto and back.",

AMC also appears to be the theater chain that will survive covid since Cinemark is closing theaters and regal is talking bankruptcy. I don't see it hitting $1000, even in a squeeze, but buying in is so afordable that there's NO downside.\n\nHollywood is America's number ONE export and requires movie theaters to keep the country's income flowing. It'll get bought out or bailed out before they let Hollywood go under. \n\nGME was a dying brand before covid and it's far too risky. But I love all things game and I bought in to help support the cause. \n\nI review where the stock normally sits (non-covid) so I know if it's artificially low and how much potential there is if/when it'll go back to \"normal\".",

Amazon is a great service, however, do not let that undermine pleasant experiences at the movies. Inflation will push the value higher to a more fair price on par with the capabilities of the company. The company is making some good moves. I do not see any reason this stock can not reach $1,000. Timing is the only question. Meme stock associations are good publicity. Monkey hold.",

I like to use https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html to see exactly what my gains would be. But essentially with my research and tiny dumb ape brain I decided that the high risk was the best way I could ensure that we'd become millionaires if AMC shot up. I was comfortable with my risk and like you said, was able to buy large quantities in my budget. I'm even buying more so I put in another order for more call options exp in April along with more shares. I wouldn't have been able to do this buying in the money. But I'm not advising anyone to do this as it is super risky and you can lose your entire investment. Like I said. Not a financial advisor. Just dumb 🦍 with 💎🖐",

Unless you are a day trader and you're buying at the dips and selling at the highs with a prepared strategy then I if I were you I wouldn't sell and just continue to hold. But that's just me.

I mean I can't tell you what to do because I'm not a financial advisor so don't trust me and do your research first but if you look up your question on YouTube you will see many videos explaining why you shouldn't exercise your option. From my understanding, you're just leaving profit on the table. If you want to own 100 shares it could be profitable for you because you would be buying them at your strike price of $8 so you'd be paying $800 to own 100 shares and if AMC is shooting up as I hope it will, then it could make sense to exercise your option and continue to hold the shares as they increase. But you're leaving a few hundred or so on the table because your giving up the intrinsic value of the option. But again I am a very dumb ape. Which is not to say apes are dumb. Apes are smart.

New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.\n\n\\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.\n\n\\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!\n\nThere's probably more driving this but thats all I can think of right now\n\n*Edit*\\--*corrected to say SI report comes out tonight, thanks for pointing that out*\n\n*Edit--Added in the bit about Conan, thanks to Alexis418 for pointing that one out!*",

During a shortsqueeze the daily stock value isnt an important or interesting metric.\n\n​\n\nThe interesting metrics are: - Volume (should be low on down spikes) - Short interest - Short vs float - Short percentage - Catalysts that provoke a need to cover and other such indicators of scarcity of stock supply.\n\n​\n\nNothing else matters. **The importance of the pricepoint between now and the squeeze is seriously almost ZERO. Green days dont matter, nor do reds.**\n\n​\n\nI know you smooth brains are used to looking at \"green good\" \"red bad\" AND that you all have the attention spans of hamsters which makes you question valid DD because \"why no print money yet, boring\" but with volume so low and so little circulation its easy to make the line do funny things.\n\n​\n\nKnow the DD, and know what a fucking shortsqueeze is and how it works before you panic about nothing. Its actually dangerous being uninformed. It leads you to make poor (financial) decisions, opens you up to being receptive to misinformation and unintentionally makes you have a bad effect on the mindset of others that are also less than optimally informed.\n\n​\n\nDuring or leading up to the point of a shortsqueeze it is NOT buying that gets the price up like in normal market situations. So dont focus on it\n\n​\n\nDont beg for whales to come help buy.\n\nDont beg DFV to post (for some reason?!)\n\nDont look at red numbers and doubt the underlying DD that you did before investing (Right? RIGHT?)\n\nDont overcelebrate green moments or days like Jesus' second coming.\n\n​\n\n**The moonshot in a shortsqueeze situation comes from endless demand impulse when shorts are required to cover, combined with unavailability of shares to do so with because theyre owned by shareholders. This means that holding a certain percentage suffices, although increasing also increases pressure and squeeze leverage.**\n\n​\n\nIn such a situation a bullshit instant gratification attitude would be bad. I encourage everyone who has invested or is planning to actually read up on what a shortsqueeze is because otherwise you'd falsely assume everyone is just randomly shouting \"hold\" and \"it will come\".\n\n​\n\nThis is not financial advise. It is simply a plea for you people to inform yourself, so that you are able to make better individual personal decisions",

I was up $25,000. Yeah, fucking $25,000. Now, for some of you, that’s not a lot. But for a 20 year old working for $10 an hour that’s a lot of fucking money. I had it all there, and didn’t even think about selling... because it was gonna keep going up, right?\n\nNow here i am, only up $1800, with my dick in my hand, waiting for another catalyst so we can hopefully squeeze again. What they did to all of us, ALL OF US, is nothing short of fucking robbery. All to protect dumb fucking billionaires that didn’t know how manage risk. Fuck those hedge funds, fuck robinhood, fuck the SEC, fuck everyone that has been involved in this fucking fraudulent market. I hope we all get our tendies, because they did nothing short of opening up your wallet and taking out all your money. Actually even worse than that. \n\ngood luck to all you apes. i hope we get some payback for these cocksuckers betting against us. also rip my $25,000.",

            "Comment": "Something incredible is happening with GME the last few trading days, and it's a big deal. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market Monday which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of 💎🖐 who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying \"it's about to moon! Here we go!\"\n\nNobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. 💎🖐 need to understand this and help all the 🧻🖐 retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.\n\nWatch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.\n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\n\nAdditional details\n\nIf you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",

My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.\n\nWent on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that \"significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security\" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally \"Mason,\" answers.\n\nGeneral Summary of our conversation:\n\n\"Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?\"\n\nMason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.\n\nMe: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.\n\nMason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.\n\nMe: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?\n\nMason: No.\n\nMe: Okay . . . what limit order am I \"allowed\" to place?\n\nMason: \\*hesitates\\* It has to be within 100 points.\n\nMe: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm \"allowed\" to set for a limit order?\n\nMason: $150 is the max.\n\nMe: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.\n\nMason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!\n\nMe: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.\n\nMason: ......\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?\n\nAnd why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?\n\nEdit: Mason was so aggressive, so defensive. I didn't anticipate that. I also don't understand why someone would be that aggressive",

I was like, yea that sucks guess I'll just have to hold onto it for fucking ever and maybe one day I can get my money back. I was down so hard. I do not have money. I am a poor motherfucker and I yolo'd everything I could spare. 150 dollars. Into GME. I borrowed another 70 from a friend just so I could get 2 at 110. And I honestly didn't care if it took off or not. I simply wanted to watch wall street sweat and be a part of the movement that shed light on the shady shit that goes on there. I was totally prepared to watch it ride to zero and just count it as the cost of revolution. So I've held this whole time. I considered averaging down at $43 but I really couldn't afford it if it tanked further so I didn't.\n\nI was one of the late joining bag holders. It took me a while to get my fidelity account setup and ready I wanted in before Jan 27/28 but couldn't get my funds approved and transferred and settled before then. This is giving me hope again. Hope that I'll recoup my investment in addition to the exposure that came from this which was my real reason for getting into it. Yea I wanted to make some money too but, I'd never considered stocks before this. Thank you retards so much for all the posts these last weeks. I lurk here and read and rarely post. Sincerely hope this takes off and I can make at least what I put into it and maybe more! Ty so much guys! Obligatory Rocket Emjois! (I'm on computer and don't know how to make them.)",

But I stare down and all I see are my fucking paper hands with a $1000 deficit.\n\nAlas, It's too late for me, but it's not too late for the rest of yous.  DON'T SELL.  Hold.  Make this shoot out of the Milky Way.  Make the Hedgies pay.  Sing GME shanties if you need to force yourself off the sell button to stay on course.

There would be negative impacts to processing for short sales, the use of securities lending as a financing tool, and institutional trade processing operations.\"\n\nT+0 sure might take some implementation changes and people would have to rewrite some software.  But what's the big deal, software is constantly changing and updating.  The big problem is right there in the open: it would eliminate the window between going short and having to cover, closing the naked shorting loophole forever.\n\nThe DTCC is perpetuating a trillion dollar naked short / counterfeit fraud on behalf of Schwab, eToro, Robinhood, and friends.  So far it seems like Fidelity and IBKR are on the up and up and are pissed that their counterparties are engaging in this behavior.

For one of us morons if we trade $1 million dollars it costs us $100.  When hedgefunds buy and sell repeatedly to each other to move the price while costing very little capital they would actually feel it.  The billions of dollars in volume they trade would translate to hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading costs to them.

The external clearing system between brokers has pretty much no regulation and the DTCC most likely doesn’t even know what’s going on there. \n\nI mean, AFAIK the FTDs are reports from the DTCC which only makes up 20% of the market volume. The rest is handled between the brokers without any oversight. It’s the Wild West of trading. This shit needs to be fixed first. \n\nThe SEC doesn’t want to fix things though, otherwise they would have done this decades ago and wouldn’t  allow for grandfathering IOUs while simultaneously blocking enforcement of detailed FTD database - this would allow to see the trading strategy of market participants (even though it is illegal to have a trading strategy that is using the loophole of not delivering shares but IOUs on purpose). It’s all rigged. The question is, who is the puppet master. “Rant over”",

The 4 contracts were ITM at expiration, so I expected them to be called away on Monday, but they sat in my account all week. And there are plausible scenarios that even an ITM option might not get assigned/exercised, so I continued to sell more calls on those shares. Then all of a sudden, \"poof\", they're gone at the original strike price (11 days after expiration). I asked why TD failed to settle in +2 and they did not have any excuse other than a \"glitch\".

It also really only affects brokers and people with less than $25k. Certainly it would have helped with RH's liquidity issues, so it would help with those edge cases, but reduces the buffer to deal with tech/reporting issues so it's not without risk.",

This would reduce the amount of time before someone can be punished for not providing the asset they sold.\n\nThis isn’t including failure to delivers of course, but would make them significantly more apparent when they happen (GME has had significant failures to deliver for months now, for example, and is part of why people think there may be counterfeit).\n\nI am new to active trading (~few months) compared to a couple bonds through the years, so I may not have the entire idea captured here.

Peterffy was on CNBC practically boasting of aiding Citadel what, twice I believe, last week? And today , and all week, been gaming accounts trading GME and the like actively, selectively handling market data and internal transfers  (and selectively cutting them off , too) differently in one single security and its options...I called them half a dozen times after running an intercepting ssl stripping proxy between TWS  and them, and the portal and them, with exact error codes and session logs confirming this, then additionally found the employee who made the regressions in the js, enze wu, identified in onebar.js, for the transfer stuff...verified his address by using staff.ibkr.com to enumerate his domain, along with peterffy's, and contacted both about said regressions. Got no response but the transfers stopped showing an bullshit red triangle with no explanation save 'try again in a few minutes' on the transfers...which is bullshit I say because it cut them off immediately before recording them in the log and the only reason staff had to listen was because I had so much incontrovertible proof, and have, that this occurred. I got put on hold a lot, and they came back with different variations on blame settling time for transfers. Only these are internal transfers...that doesn't apply. So, I used the proxy and reversed the js, and found the exact code..it was some auth error that only tripped on very specific transactions. SSO/DH , found that...onebar.js is very interesting. I finally got an API tech to go upstairs with it but it was the holiday, so I'm trying to fix this before trading the next day...he comes back after 15 min and me explaining down to the error code and has nothing to say but, they stuck him on hold for 15 minutes call back another day. Now today with the market data being cut off prior to the halt as well, there was even a halt today right? Cause I was halted ten minutes before and through close according to ibkr... but prior to that also at the top they cut off all the market data for GME , and only gme, in TWS which I also verified more than one way. This can't have anything to do with Peterffy out and blowing Citadel publically so much last week...cause IBKR is an angel that does not any massive wrong in this incident. Calling bullshit on IBKR is not because of that the least transparent and worst of the bunch\nedit: i wasnt being a dick i actually am wondering if there was a trading halt prior to close because i don't trust ibkr to be honest in light of the rest..ok so they did halt trading at the end today. IBKR didnt handle the data consistently though, normally TWS will not blank out the last quote, and I had to restart the farms to get it back long enough to trade before the second halt. The transfers were and are a problem, that happened again postmarket and the second trading stopped they magically work again. The option was just gone today.",

Over the last 10 years real time transaction pipes have been built and there is really nothing technically preventing real-time transactions from being processed save some underlying data storage\\\\allocation constraints.  The biggest problem I see is a bandwidth problem, not in total bytes transferred but the number of transactions back and forth to settle and some general ledger quirks.    \n\n\nPart of the problem with transfers is many still go through the wires transfer systems that are literally 50+ years old in their designs.   \n\n\nThe multi-day issue is Bank A runs a batch Wednesday night, bank B gets the transactions, then those sit till Thursday night when Bank B runs their batch, then Bank A gets the transaction, then Friday night Bank A runs their batch and things get balanced out. Modern systems can generate a transaction chain that goes A->B->A ad hoc (Zelle for example) without tying to the evening batch cycles directly. The problem is you still have statement cycle activity that is baked into the batches. There is still balancing that has to be done and feeds into other systems that look at DDA\\\\TDA transactions but progress is moving forward in the industry.  \n\n\nI give it 10 more years and we'll be well over 50% handling things real time, it will hinge on if banking can get it's systems into a cloud based scalable infrastructure versus the existing mainframe batch processing system that drives it today. It took us 50 years to get here, it will take at least 50 years to retire the old systems completely.",

            "Comment": "The knock on effects would be specific to the micro-industry of trade settlement and clearing. We were/are tying to use the most sophisticated software to match trades up and prevent settlement issues, but the reality is that there are many thousands (possibly tens of thousands, idk) of real humans *on top of that* fixing everything which inevitably goes wrong on the back-end. Technology can only do so much, especially when everybody (brokers/clients) by nature must use similar trade matching programs if they're going to match at all. Modernizing such a large operational mass is, unsurprisingly, very slow. Not because of incompotence in creating a better one, but for ensuring the safety and security of the global trading system as a whole. \n\nTherefore, we need to have a fuckton of humans to fill in the gaps. Whether the stamp fees aren't allocated correctly, commissions are disagreed upon between front offices and/or back offices, there are liquidity issues with a certain stock causing you your own FtD to another broker, buy-ins, you name it. I had to know a *ridiculous* number of rules, best practices, and general trade idiosyncrasies according to nearly every country around the world. So many, it makes my legal job look like a cakewalk. The current system is strained enough due to trade ops being largely viewed as a cost to the bottom line. While all clients/brokers would be better off for having larger trade ops teams, they'd have to do so simultaneously so as to not allow their competitors to have an edge in cost. The current capitalist society demands we compete against one another instead.\n\nWe are at odds between paragraphs one and two:\n\n1. \"Why can't you just build software to automate everything?\" Okay, tell me how. I'll wait.\n\n2. \"Why can you just hire more people in trade ops so the system can move faster?\" Because most businesses don't run on goodwill or efficiency, they run on capital. Specifically, by generating more capital than their competitors. Costs are clearly part of that equation.",

The problem I see is that if the same share passes through so many brokers' hands, then eventually they lose sight of where the original share came from. The current system lacks transparency, and thus it's notoriously hard to find and punish people. And of course the general incompetence of the SEC doesn't help.\n\nBlock chain networks can fix that by maintaining a ledger of lent shares. If a share has already been lent, then anyone would be able to see where and when that happened. Accountability is everything. That way the enforcers can say \"oh this share has been lent out 2 times already... maybe you shouldn't do this again.\"",

As long as there is human error, you generally need another human to fix it.\n\n\"Ideally\", you centrally stop (how?) the whole machine for sake of moving over to the modern one, and deal with the errors that it throws off (hopefully less in number and scope than the old system).\n\nOr you shoehorn it in, piece by piece, as we've been doing year after year.\n\nThis comes back to my original point about the safety and security of the system: which method is more reasonable? The industry/world has chosen the latter.",

Also, theta decay will fuck his options if he doesn’t either roll them out a week, or sell the contracts for the premium in the morning. Theta decay is a bitch, that’s why weekly options fall in value so fast.

So 342 contracts = 34,200 shares. \n\nMajority of his holdings is in $9 calls (284) which I’m assuming he bought at .32 cents a piece. Anything above $9.32 is all ITM (in the money) + a small premium since they expire next week. So, AMC closed AH at $11.09. $11.09-9.32 = 1.77 x (28,400 shares) = $50,268.  (This is assuming we open at $11.09 and he is able to sell all of those calls). My bet is AMC opens higher and he makes even more than just $50k. \n\nI’m guessing he bought these recently too. 🎲 It’s definitely a darn good Wallstreetbet 🍻",

And sure he can simply sell the contract and profit from the premium, but he could also exercise the contract and buy 100 shares at $16. This would mean, however that his break even price before he can profit is $16 PLUS his premium that he paid. In this particular case, he’d need it to go to $16.05 (which I know isn’t much more) but it’s still not $16 like many people think. \n\nThe point is, if he wanted to profit from the premium increase, it’d be wise for him to sell the contract tomorrow morning, otherwise he’ll have to hold until it hits $16 so he can exercise it, or it expires worthless.",

I saw enough gains three weeks ago that I’m sure there’s a lot of fresh powder that was just waiting for this moment.\n\nJust make sure to actually sell at or near the highs if you’re in now, or you play the super risky but possibly super profitable move of buying at the open of extended or regular hours trading.",

Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue.",

All you have to do is find the queen and catch her, the rest will follow. I do it bare handed. I've been called a bee whisperer lol cause I just talk to them as they walk into a cardboard box.

I’ll charge cheap rent to some friends to help cover monthly mortgage payments and then probably end up paying some every month too.\n\nMy plan is to only consider selling once I have made 1.5 million so I’ll have more than enough left after taxes where it will be 1 million, and I’ll keep 100k for the stock market and he rest in the bank. Thinking about it now, I want enough that I’ll be able to have 200k in stock market and 1 million in bank account after taxes 😎\n\nEdit: I’d like to add that I’ll only CONSIDER it at the post, the stock would only need to be worth roughly 18k so if this shit is going to 100k, I’m not missing out",

He is a prominent reason why this company is on the path to success again (they now have a shit ton of money they can invest in to improving the company because of his dedication towards the company and publicity that came from it) and he can legitimately help turn the fundamentals of the company around to make the company more consumer friendly (which would draw in more loyal customers) since he was at one point (not even a year ago), just like us.",

This was my shot to get a tiny bit ahead. As the stock was rocketing, I was applying for brokerage accounts. Robinhood first, because I’d been referred by a family member. Conveniently, they took about 5 days to approve. I had applied for Webull too and, fortunately, they only took a couple of days. Approved on Sunday, so I was waiting for Monday. It started dropping before I could get in. Still, I had alot of hope. I had transferred enough from an account I’d been saving for emergencies for 14 years to buy 2 measly shares. Sounds like nothing to most, but it was a lot for me. Fast forward a few days and I’m immediately $500 in the red. Like a moron, I blindly jumped into something I knew very little about. After a couple days of shock and talking to my wife, I decided I’d hold. For years, if I had to. I didn’t care how low it went. I knew the risk & I jumped in head first anyway. I didn’t think it would come back. I stared at it everyday...hoping and praying. I watched the hearing. I knew we were all being screwed by the wealthy...what else is new? I lost an emergency fund that I’d been saving for 14 years (Sad, I know.) Again, I knew it could happen but, damn, the reality sucked. I’ve spent the past month holding onto my 2 little GME shares while steadily trying to level out with AMC and losing a dollar here and there on penny stocks. I just wanted to get a little back and make my best effort to right my wrong with my family. I’m still in the red, and I may never see green again. But you can bet your ass I’m holding. These “Experts” have made millions just by being “Experts.” Most of us don’t get that opportunity. If they wanna talk down to us & bitch and complain about what we’re trying to do, their core demographic sure as hell isn’t the average Joe. They cater to those that are already wealthy. So, even though my knowledge is extremely limited, I have no choice but to tune out the “Experts.” They have no clue. They can’t relate to reasons behind this movement. They’ll never get it. People wanna poke fun at “The guy in his mom’s basement....har har har.” That guy’s trying to find a way to be able to afford a place of his own. Personally, I’m nearing 40. Married 13 years with a 7 year old that LOVES horses. I desperately want to be able to give her a house on acreage one day. But we can’t save to save our lives. Something always happens. We build up savings, the entire HVAC system dies. Build back up...refrigerator, washer, and dryer all go bad within a week of each other. Build back up...painters find rotten wood behind the siding on our house. HOI won’t cover. Deplete savings to basically have the side of our house rebuilt. So, something like this comes along, and you think it’s finally your chance to get ahead. Immediately, you’re slapped back into reality by losing all of it. It starts to come back, and the rich wanna bitch about it? Go home, drink whatever $10k wine you’ve been saving, and shut the hell up while the rest of us try to piece together a tiny portion of our “Dreams.”",

One of the older admins told the younger ones they needed to migrate off that server right in the final 30 days before his retirement.  The kids rolled their eyes and took grandpa out for drinks.\n\nThe only person aware of the server is one of the janitors.  He's not quite sure on the specifics, but he did figure out that if he cues up a bunch of buy orders with prices 30% below market open, goes to work, unplugs the server so he can plug his floor buffer in, and then makes sure to plug the server in before he goes home, all his orders fill.  On sell days of course he doesn't buff the floors.",

They still have automated systems that will mark accounts to be shut down, though this is usually for extremely delinquent accounts. \n\nThe thing is, your payment actually processes in a batch with thousands of other payments. Your bank may pull the money from your account immediately, but they still have to wait for the batch to process, with usually happens once or twice a day. If they miss a cutoff, that whole batch may process on the next day. You'd hope that the utility or credit counseling agencies are proactive in fixing the payments, especially with system wide issues like this, but this isn't always the case. \n\nSource: I work for a major payment processing network and have seen this happen on a smaller scale.",

It's a over priced, relatively small automaker in a very niche market, and it doesn't even make a quality vehicle. On top of that you could be buying silver!!. It is an essential component in every electrically powered product you own or use. Green new deal, solar, wind, 5G, space, military all rely on silver to run and it has been manipulated for more than 100 years. WSB seems to have drank some crazy kool aid and now you guys are just buying whatever post you see come up. Free the system buy physical Silver.",

That said, you can warm the car up from the app which might help clearing snow/ice off of it you'd just have to plan ahead.  The biggest concern would be battery life & maintaining charge.  You likely wouldn't get the full power of the regenerative braking or the horsepower since it will throttle how much energy can enter/leave the battery in an environment that cold.  The battery can generally warm itself up over time but I'm not sure how long that would take in that cold of an environment.  Snowy days here in the 20s it can take 15+ minutes of driving for the full power to kick in.  My model is older though, there may have been improvements since.

Start with 20 and watch. If you still like it, buy 20 more on a dip. Don’t try and guess the top or bottom and go all in. Same thing for selling. You think stock is reaching a support range or a limit? Sell off 20% to lock in some gain, if it goes down, buy back in with your profit. If it goes up, watch and sell some more. If you’re up against the day trader rule, be patient, trust your plan, and make your moves over a few days. Stocks go up and down. That’s what they do.",

Again, in my opinion only, these should be marked as such.  Like a \"(this happened 2 years ago)\" before the paragraph or after the paragraph to acknowledge \"not a current event\".\n\nSome of the tactics here are to catch a dumb ass, which is fine because it really is the responsibility of the investor to know their investment moves.  That being said, there are those that are weak in knowledge of investing and have serious funds to invest.  If the trend to trap a sap continues, the word will get out that r/wallstreetbets is a scam, a lead into failed stocks etc. and the media will pick up on it and maybe hold people liable for the improper info.\n\nI don't care, cause i don't do that.",

Ceo of Citadel is in prison for fraud. Vladimir took the first flight to Bulgaria Interpol is searching him. Valve sold Steam to Gamestop and Amazon is talking with Gamestop to sell Twitch.\nE-Sports announce there new partnership with Gamestop to organise tournaments. Jim Cramer cries for the first time live on tv and you see Gamestop charts pre market. You get a heart attack and die. That's life. Everything can happen. The most important thing in life is your health, family and friends. If God want you to earn money and get rich to test you with your wealth you get it. Otherwise you can do what you want if it's not in your destiny to get rich you will never be rich in life. That's your test in life. Everyone get tested someone as poor someone as rich.",

And you want to set a “sell limit”, when the stock reaches the set price your sale will automatically be triggered. On fidelity you can only set that sale limit to 50% above the market price, which in this example is $150. So 150/2 = $75. So 50% above market price would be $150 + $75 = $225. So it won’t let you set a sell limit higher than $225. Not all apps do that apparently. I think that’s right. Just a noob learning on the fly.",

With this rule, you'll have to place your order above the ask, over 100.01, so the only way you can short sell is if enough people buy so that the price and the bid and the ask all move up, so that your open order is on the ask.  Then, your order will become the best ask and it can be filled, only by having the share price move up.\n\nWithout this, sellers of legit shares wanting to exit their position could create a race to the bottom with short sellers trying to profit off the price movement.  By doing this it allows a little more stability and liquidity and also gives people more opportunity to close their positions, because they can still sell their shares on the bid.",

Sure you could say stimulus checks are inflationary but they aren’t sustained, you’ll get a quick sugar high and then it’ll wear off. So if anything I think inflation levels will be volatile in the coming months. \n\nI think it’s important to remember there are 2 factors that need to be taken into account. You bring it up in your post, money supply (how much they are printing) and the velocity of money (how often it changes hands when spent). \n\nThe fed knowingly inflates asset prices when it cuts rates. Houses and margin loans become cheaper to get. But that doesn’t exactly have a direct effect on the price of things like food unless the money printed gets in the hands of the lower class who is more than likely to spend it. And you would need rising wages + stimulus to see sustained inflation at that level.",

So long as investments stay in place, it keeps inflation as measured by CPI relatively stable (since people don't really expand the basket of goods they buy for their regular use, no one needs extra TVs).\n\n\\---\n\nAlso the CPI is a poor measure of inflation overall , because technology makes prices go down, like TVs have dropped 95% in price over the last 20 years or so for Large screens. So even if the cost of the base materials goes up, because flat panel TVs are using far less raw materials the price seems to go lower, helping to bring the average of the CPI basket down a bit, making inflation look muted. Cost cutting technology is basically saving the world from experiencing more inflation.",

There is now $104 more in existence than before because the feds printed it and bought the bond with it. However Apple will have to pay $105 to whoever holds the bond (the fed reserve) in May 2021.

CPI does not increase with \"reasonable\" increases of wages or spending.\n\nLook at every minimum wage increase over the last 30 years and then look at CPI in the year following. The CPI goes down EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME. That money goes straight into the economy but it's not enough to drive up prices. That's both due to how poor we've made people through our fucked up economic policy and how much goods and services are actually available.\n\nAlso consider that if there is inflation it's mostly going to fall on the bulk of goods manufactured abroad. So then that risk is shared and then it is mitigated by those countries enacting policy to keep their currency weak compared to the dollar. They want growing economies and employed citizens and if they have to keep the dollar strong to achieve that then that's what they'll do.\n\nI think the big threat right now is civil unrest and a loss of faith in Federal institutions. The dollar has value because the Fed says so. When average Americans no longer give a flip what the Fed says then that's when the dollar is most at risk. \n\nCivil unrest in a mass surveillance state is a loser for common people. They'll be found out before they can get started. \n\nBut pulling your money out of the economy and using Boldemort and others to buy and sell things could be the most powerful subversive act of the new millennium. Good luck on the surveillance state trying to counter that. Just admitting they have a problem will make it worse.",

There are really good, smart questions here.   \n\n\nThe reason I wrote this is because many people weren't going to read the book that Burry posted. So I wanted to summarise it, make it easier to eat. Who reads books nowadays \n\nMany of your questions are answered in the book. The book lists many historical events that occured in EXACTLY the same way as what is happening today- a Central Bank deviating from its main goal of price-stability into trying to employ everyone in the economy. \n\nPrice inflation usually takes YEARS to gestate. It takes YEARS before it trickles into the economy. But once the dam wall breaks, it breaks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso...This isn't a catastrophic event. 70% inflation is not hyperinflation if it's spread out over 5 years even. Hyperinflation is 33% per year. This is not THAT bad. Fuck, it's still fucking bad, but the alternative is worse. The alternative is that the poor become trapped out of this stupid 'gamified' stocks game and work ever increasing hours to try and rent properties in shitty apartments they cannot afford. \n\nWhat do you need to do now? Just watch out for the inflation, if it doesn't come...cool...stonks carry on going up. If you start to see it creeping...and then running away, at least you will know what the fuck is going on.\n\nMay the tendies be with you.",

They’re able to pay high dividends because they have fixed/limited costs and lots of free cash flow. They may not be high growth in terms of stock value increases, but they generate a lot of free cash flow and generally have low debt (I’ve been looking for companies with low debt in case the economy tanks again). It turns out those companies do better during high inflation than other companies. So I’ve been seeing good gains this week as other investors pile in to energy, financials, REIT’s & etc.\n\nCompanies with free cash flow and low debt are suddenly popular this week for a reason!

They're buying the milk they would have bought anyway when they had a job and weren't forced to sit the fuck at home. \n\nSure there'll be some temporary cyclical inflation (pent up demand in hospitality, travel etc), but won't be persistent. \n\n*Deflation* is *worse* than *inflation*.

Remember when currency is created(usd) it can’t be destroyed unless a debt is paid in full. For the most part it moves around from one account to another. (Transferred)When assets fail the currency looks to move to safe havens. So one level collapses to the next downward.  The one thing missing is silver which will be at the very bottom tip of gold. Therefore I feel this system is intentional with a money transfer from those who don’t know to those that do every 10 years or so. There are no mistakes.

But I can add it here, because it can allow me to address the fundamental question you asked- unemployment and inflation.\n\n\\-Inflation has already happened; in stocks.\n\n\\-Inflation in CPI happens when that money (that was printed) leaks into the rest of the population which leads people to go out and purchase from a limited supply of goods- bam CPI inflation. \n\nYou're last paragraph hits the nail on the head...inflation doesn't  happen in CPI until the money gets into the hands of the lower class...how would it get there---stimulus checks.

People were listening in to see if there were going to be interest rates rising (not like with his view of inflation) - you see big movements out of stocks if the risk free rate goes up; why hold stocks when other instruments give a similar yield.\n\nWhat is interesting is you can peg sentiments on individual stocks if you watch carefully; massive rotation out of meme and hype stocks that reversed some of that loss intraday; you wouldn't notice if you just looked at the open and close price. I'm looking at you, Tesla.\n\nI think you are already seeing rotation out of these high growth (share price), low earnings and income (or negative on both) that have stupid valuations. If you get 120% from some hype stock in 12 months, why not just get the fuck out when things go sour. Pretty much everyone of these stocks is priced like they will change the world, fuckers push a load of stories in the news to make you believe, then leave you holding bags; they know retail investors love looking at historic price yet are too lazy to do any financial due diligence.

Immediately after losing his ass to gourds, the following things happened:\n\n\n- He resorted to eating the ornamental gourds. The recipe included boiling them for 3 hours.\n\n\n- He lost $1,000 in credit card advance on a straight up bet for the Kansas City Chiefs to win the Super Bowl.\n\n\n- He found the precious metal futures market and decided Rhodium was going to hit 40k. He went on a shady Slovakian version of Wish and bought an 8 gram chunk of “Rhodium” for $4,000 via a credit card.\n\n\n- He posted the “Rhodium” on a metals subreddit, and found out that he spent $4,000 on a worthless piece of scrap metal. The listing he bought disappeared, and he had no recourse for a refund, because he was the only person who didn’t see that it was a scam.\n\n\n- He’s now moving to Uruguay to start a new life.

Stocks can go to infinity and nobody would really blink an eye because the underlying economy hasn’t all changed much. In fact, I’d argue most people root for inflation in stocks, they just call it multiple expansion. Companies that cost 19x earnings before may now cost 24x and that be the new normal. \n\nStimulus checks in itself won’t cause enough inflation to raise alarm bells, however, piggy backing off my last paragraph. Eventually people sell stocks to buy things. You asked how money trickles into the economy, that will be how, along with businesses raising wages. If done so in a controlled manor I think they can manage this by slowly raising rates. What I’m actually worried about inflation wise, is the wealth transfer from the baby boomers to my generation (millennials). I think then you’ll see a major spending spree as people will buy homes, cars, and travel. But who knows. It’s all just theory.",

Land-owners. Those guys can't run and if they did we could just seize the asset.\n\nIt happened at the end of the roman empire (leading to a few organisms owning most of Europe while peasants did not own land anymore) and it will happen again this century.",

My parents, and their brothers, sisters, cousins, etc didn't live rich but they all have huge savings.  Many sat on their cash.  Recently my cousin died (75 yrs old).  He was a machinist.  We were shocked to find out he had just under 2 million saved.  He lived so simple and just stashed it all.  Main reason I think is not actually the boomers.  It's their parents that lived during the great depression that taught their kids (boomers) how to save and live simple.  Point is.  That money will be entering the economy when those people pass as you pointed out.  And what accelerates it even more is that many will live longer and continue to increase wealth via real estate holdings, stocks, bonds, SS, etc.  Interesting stuff.",

There are countless examples where the size or quantity has gone down rather than increasing the price. If you look at a box of cereal from today, the \"family size\" is the size that the normal box used to be. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are an obvious one too. They're like half the size they once were.\n\nI'm speculating here but I'm sure there are lots of other less obvious examples that the average consumer wouldn't see, where cheaper or less materials are being used in manufacture as well -- like say 10% more water used to make ketchup rather than raising the price by 10% or decreasing size by 10% (or maybe some combination of all 3).\n\nThere are costs being cut all over the place to keep the prices from going up, but it's going to eventually get to the point where it's inevitable and they have no choice. By then they will have exhaused all of their cost saving measures and there's nowhere left to go but raising the price.",

I will enjoy my house more, and get probably 150% return on the money spent in ten years when I eventually sell the place.

This wouldn’t matter much if the economy wasn’t primarily composed of two things:\n\n1.\tIrrational actors: People are dumb. They see falling prices, they panic. This is when bank runs and (like you said) hoarding can happen. Just like runaway inflation, it can also lead to distrust of fiat currency and movement into “inherently valuable” things like gold and silver. The reason this is irrational is because falling prices don’t mean much when *everything* is falling. That is, unless the economy is built upon...\n2.\t Debt and credit: Inflation and deflation interact directly with interest rates. The real interest rate of any debt is calculated by subtracting inflation from the “price tag” or nominal interest rate. The reason for this is obvious if you think about it. If I take a loan of $1000 to be paid off exactly one year later at 100% interest (meaning the loan is worth $2000 to my bank), but the economy goes through 50% inflation during that period, that loan is now worth $1500 to the bank in real terms at the end of the year. If the economy instead experiences 50% deflation, that loan is now worth $2500 in real terms to your bank at the end of the year. You can see just from this simple example that deflation fucks over debtors. Most people are debtors. In a deflationary economy, your student loans, mortgages, car loans, etc all have a real interest rate *above* their stated rate. That will lead to more bankruptcies and defaults, for obvious reasons. Which leads to more deflation, *since those literally delete money from the economy*. Oof.",

A month ago I didn't know what a stock was. And right now my thought is basically that I just want to jump onto this thing that looks like it's going up again.\n\nMy plan is to watch it and buy in if it's still making vertical jumps. If that's still happening, I'll wait for a dip and then buy in. And then I will vigilantly watch the chart and see what happens. I think the big lesson I've learned in my short time is to truly wait for a dip and don't just buy at the new high. And I know what a dip looks like now. But maybe there'll be no dip and I'll lose out, we'll see...\n\nI've been watching it in after hours, wondering how much it'll cost me to buy in, and it was jumping around between $135 - 200 the whole time. At times it felt like it had found a new bottom, where it was holding for half an hour, but then it jumped around again. It seemed like $170 was the new bottom and then it jumped back to $135 for a fair while before going to $180. And then to 170 again and then back to 180. My hope is that it will continue to jump around like this and then I can get the dip and then in ten minutes I'll be up $40 a share.",

The $0.25 is so cheap because the seller thinks it's very unlikely the stock price will hit $140 in 3 days. To buy it, you buy a contract, which is 100 shares \\* the premium price (100 \\* $0.25). So you are betting $25 that the stock price will hit $140 before expiry. Lo and behold the stock price climbs dramatically and now suddenly everybody wants your contract! They want it so badly that you can sell for $100 even before expiry! So, if you sell it before expiry you make $100 \\* 100 contacts. $10,000.",

Ideally they would want to cover their premium too, so $25,500+$300=$25,800. Or, $258 a share. \n\nGME closing above $258 for user = game on. \n\nIf GME closes below $255 then user loses $300.",

            "Comment": "A call is a bet that the stock will go up. You need to guess three things when trading calls: the direction, the date and the strike price.\n\nSay you can buy stock right now at $100 and you think it will increase to above $150 by March 19 for some reason. You could just buy the stock. 100 shares will cost $10,000. \n\nYou don't really care what happens on March 19, as long as the stock increases you are happy. You can sell at any time.\n\nInstead, you could buy a call option. You have to decide on the exit price (strike) and maturity. In our example, the strike is 150 and maturity March 19. One call option controls 100 shares and you will pay a premium to purchase this. The value of a call has two components: intrinsic value, which is the difference between the stock and the strike, floored at zero, so max(0, stock-strike). As an example of the stock is 100 and the strike 150, the intrinsic value is 0. If the stock is 150 and strike 150, intrinsic value is 0 and if the stock is 160 and strike is 150, the intrinsic value is 10. These positions are out of the money (OTM), at the money (ATM) and in the money (ITM) respectively \n\nThe second component of the call value is time value, or theta. The longer the time to maturity, the higher the probability that the stock can increase. Higher volatility therefore results in higher call option price.\n\nOk back to our example. Instead of buying the actual stock, you buy a 150 strike call option  expiring March 19. If the stock finishes at 160 that day, you've made (160-10)*100 or $1,000. You had to pay a premium to buy the call, but since it's so deep out of the money, maybe you paid $0.25. that's per share and recall there are 100 shares per option so you pay $25. Net profit 975.\n\nYou only put up 25, but got the profit of holding 100 shares on an investment of about 10,000 if you bought long. The fact that you can enjoy the profit of the underlying sticks without having to actually own the stocks gives you a lot of leverage.\n\nRisks. Options are very risky and most people lose money. If the stock finishes at 149, you get nothing and lost the premium whereas if you own the stock outright, you still have the stock. \nTo exit an option before expiry, you can just close the position. You can also choose to take delivery of the shares. But you'll have to pay 100*150 (100 shares times 150/share) which is why most people just close out the position. You can also roll your option.
