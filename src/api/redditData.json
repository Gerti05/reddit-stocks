Rather wait until the next morning and short it at the open.\n\nIf you did this for Roku today you be up 17-points\n\nAMZN was at 3340 just before the open, closed at 3291\n\nZoom peaked at 304, closed at 295\n\nAnyway, I ended up $57 in the green (no big deal) but when I opened my acct this morning I was up $407.   Point?  This market tends to open high and sell off every day.",

Then when I take a large position it never works out. \n\nLike I literally brought my account from 10k > $180 > $2.8k this week. My performance is horrible, but ignoring that it's like, why all these massive gains from small.positions? I couldn't even 2x 10k but I 12x $180... \n\nAnd I've done this a few times. It's always the small positions that are the ten baggers, and I've never gone positive once I hit 10-12k. \n\nPoisotions:\n\nSpy puts \nTsm calls \nCash",

All they need is a solid “uh oh” to tarnish that and set them back. \n\nThat said, one thing I haven’t seen is whether they properly pivoted to the skin and personal care segment; when the market crashes, it’s good to look at the “Lipstick Index.” Women usually buy that when times are tough. Because of masks, women this time around went all in on personal care and skin. If HNST put pedal to the metal capitalizing on that when indications were early, then I’d feel they can at least be fast and nimble, which can’t be underestimated going up against all these titans.",

That said I have had great results lately from home improvement stores. Costco, Lowe’s, Home Depot all making runs. Find a down day, then find a down swing in that down day, then pick up calls close to the money with at least 6 weeks to run. Make sure you understand options before you buy them. Check bid ask and make sure the spread is tight, and that volume and open interest are high. It’s so easy to fuck yourself. Not financial advice.",

Buy 100 shares of it. Then sell covered calls. Picking the highest premium isn't always the best idea, because it increases your chances of missing out on profit. Tasty Trade figures that 16 delta on 45 DTE calls gives you the best return and that you'll only miss out on profit ~14.9% of the time. \n\nWhether you buy to close after collecting back some theta or ride it to expiry, at some point your shares are going to get called away. You'll keep your premium and however much gain the stock got to before it hits the strike you sold at. What you do then if you still like the stock is sell cash secured puts. The closer to the money you sell the put, the more likely you are to get assigned, but the more premium you'll collect. If you think it still has room to run, maybe sell at the money. If you think it's going to go revert to the mean, go ahead and sell the put closer to the mean and get paid to buy at a price you like.\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\n>Cool story, but I asked what stocks to use.\n\nIf you've got the capital, pick your favorite blue chip. AAPL, MSFT, what the fuck ever. If you're broke, don't just buy a flat trading shit stock because you can afford it. Actually do some DD and pick something you've got a reason to think would be worth holding for 5 years or more. On the cheap end of things, I personally like NOK but would want to snag it closer to $4. \n\nOne thing you could do is start by selling puts on stocks you like at prices you like.",

            "Comment": "Your **delta** is how quickly the value of your contract changes with respect to the underlying stock. In other words, if the stock goes up a dollar, delta tells you how much the option price goes up. 16 delta (= 0.16 delta value) means for every dollar the stock raises, the value of the option contract goes up $0.16. \n\nThis matters, because it impacts how likely you are to get your shares called away. Recall that options have intrinsic and extrinsic value. The closer you get to expiry, the more theta decays, the less valuable the contract is, and the more the price needs to go up before expiration in order to make exercising it profitable. \n\nBasically, a lower delta for the person buying your call means that the underlying needs to go up higher than the strike price to make it worth exercising. \n\nExample:\n\n>You own 100 shares of Dildo (ticker: $DLDO). The price of $DLDO is $100. You sell a covered call on DLDO expiring today with a strike price of $101. The delta value of the contract is 0.5, or 50. Since the value of the contract only goes up 50 cents for each dollar DLDO goes up, the buyer of your contract needs DLDO to go up to $102 before the end of the day to break even. \n\n**DTE** is days to expiration. Selling contracts 45 days out gives you a worthwhile amount of premium on contracts with fairly good odds of profiting on. \n\nOne strategy is to sell the contract at 45 days, then at some percent of profit collected, buy to close (which guarantees you keep profit and shares), and then open another contract 45 days out.",

You realize how poor most of EU is, right? The preference to do Ultrasound in patients who have symptoms that would indicate the need for a CT or an MRI simply because Ultrasound (US) is cheaper? That’s called poor patient care and leads to longer waits for a proper diagnosis. Or the wait times that come along with social healthcare? So, not only do you seem to be poorly informed as to how medical progression works, you don’t realize the burden socialism puts onto countries and seemingly cannot afford it. On top of that you don’t know the subtleties of front line healthcare and how it impacts treatment. Well played, sir, well played.",
